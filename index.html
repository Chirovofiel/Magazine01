                    Chirovofiel has been really consistent with learning coding and improving on probelem solving, for weeks now.
                    He's Also patient because he knows it will take lots of time and consistent effort and discipline,
                    to be the man he was meant to be. 
                    He Practices meditations and reflections everyday, even when he doesnt understand, what he's doing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After years and years of living in trauma, addictions, psychological traps, manipulations,
                    passed down trauma's.  Years of PMO, months of weed addictions, years of scheming. He woke up and realized,
                    no one ever truly cared about him and nobody is coming to save him. How he had ths vision, can't really be put into words

               </p>
               <p>It wasn't that any being like an angel or something happened to him, he just had this wave of strong clarity,
                it was so strong, it burned all the illusions.
                Some days he cried so hard because of the traumas he face was shaking, vibrating and he realized that everyone he's ever Known just wants to take advantage but never really cared or gave two fucks about him. 

                Well he started walking more, lost appetite for food, friends, relationships....
                well one thing he's now sure of its that, he was never truly alone, the source has always been there to guide and protect him even when the world didn't KNow he was here.
                he questioned and questioned and questioned, and broke away from so many illusions such as, friends, money, lust(the hardest of all) time, famuly, messiah saviour addictions, depresssion, anxiety, lack of value, attarction to cultism, numbing, violent, pride, ego..

               <p> 
                Patience and Silence has been one of the very key features alongside meditation in understanding myself and becoming more aware of my own thoughts and actions.
                 I now know how fragile and vulnerable my brain is but also how powerful it is.
                 I'm quite grateful to myself for my risilence in never giving up in myself and in the beleive that i was destined for something really great.

               </p>
               <p>
                I now flow with my thoughts rather than fighting and labeling them overthinking and trying to stop them.
                I have learned to watch cravings rise and fall without fighting them, i no longer allow money to decide my state of being, i don't panic when i don't have
               </p>

               <p>
                Instead of fighting my urges and addictions, I uprooted them and now they dont control me and i dont control them, they just pass like a wave while the self watches them.
                It's very hard doing this on my own, very hard but it is the price of greatness.
                Now that it is obvious im on my own, i want to focus and think on how to actually come out of this, so help me God.
